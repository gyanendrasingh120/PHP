YRV's flagship product is the mobile application PocketAd (“App”) and we own and operate the App on our own behalf. </p>

<ol  style="margin-left:25px;">
<li><strong>ACCEPTANCE</strong></li>
<p>Please read the following terms and conditions of use (“Terms of Use”) carefully before you download, install, or use the App. By downloading, installing, or using the App, you indicate that you accept these Terms of Use and that you agree to abide by them. Your download, installation, or use of the App constitutes your acceptance of these Terms of Use which takes effect on the date on which you download, install, or use the App. If you do not agree with these Terms of Use, you should cease downloading, installing, or using the App immediately.</p>

<li><strong>DESCRIPTION OF APP AND CONTENT POLICY</strong> </li>
	<ol type="A" style="margin-left:40px;">
	<li>YRV is a growing team of designers, coders, and marketing professionals, aiming to constantly improve its offerings for its users</li>
	<li>Our App aims to remunerate its users for playing games made out of advertisements. Upon the accumulation of the rewards by the user, the user has the option through the App to do the following:</li>
		<ul style="margin-left:40px;">
        <li>Redeem the points to recharge his/her mobile (in case of pre-paid users); or</li>
        <li>Obtain a discount on the monthly phone bill (in case of post-paid users); or</li>
        <li>Obtain a DTH recharge; or</li>
        <li>Donate the redeemed amount to certain NGOs</li>
        </ul>

	<li>We display plans/tariff packs in the “Redeem” section. The user is advised to confirm that, and not redeem points based solely on the information displayed there</li>
	<li>Donation is not transferred by us to the beneficiaries in portions chosen by the user, but in lump sums monthly </li>
    <li>If the gaps between two redemptions exceed six months, the accumulated rewards, if any, in the user’s account may expire </li>
	<li>The daily and monthly limits on maximum earning will be capped from our end and can be revised from time to time. Further, a monthly limit for redemption could be set as well if deemed fit by us</li>
	<li>We reserve the right to discontinue the referral feature at our discretion. Waiting referrals may not be awarded on successful conversion in such an event</li>
    <li>Notification tabs may be used to showcase promotional material </li>
        <li>We reserve the right to change these Terms of Use at any time without notice to you by posting notifications in the App or by updating the App to incorporate the new Terms of Use. You are responsible for regularly reviewing information posted online to obtain timely notice of such changes. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the amended Terms of Use</li>
    	<li>To download, install, access, or use the App, you must be at least thirteen years of age </li>
	    <li>Any content available on the App is not intended to amount to advice on which reliance should be placed. Subject to paragraphs 5 and 8 below, we therefore disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such contents by any user of the App, or by anyone who may be informed of any of its contents</li>



</ol>
