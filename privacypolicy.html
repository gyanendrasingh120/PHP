<p>PocketAd is a mobile application managed and owned by YRV Apportunity LLP. On PocketAd, you can engage with advertisements, and if your engagement matches a predetermined type of engagement, you are rewarded monetarily (to be availed as prepaid mobile recharge or postpaid bill discount, DTH recharges, or to be given out as donation).</p>

<p>In a world of specialization and competition, there are goods and services for all your needs and wants, and such goods/services are being provided by a number of companies/businesses. We collect information in order to be able to provide you with advertisements which, in our opinion, will be most significant and useful to you.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</strong></p>

<li><strong>We collect information from you when you may choose to link your PocketAd account with your Facebook account</strong>. In such a case, in addition to the information specified above, we collect all information that you authorize us to collect at the time of linking us with your Facebook account. This consists of, but may not be limited to, your interests, education level, employment status, etc.</li>

		<ol type="A" style="margin-left:40px;">
	<li><strong>Device information:</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Log information:</strong></li>
    <p>When you use our services, we may automatically collect and store certain information. This may include:</p>
   		 <ul  style="margin-left:30px;">

     </ol>
</ol>




<p><strong>HOW WE USE THIS INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p>The information that we gather out of your usage of our services is used to provide the services we provide, maintain and improve them, conceptualize and create new services, and to protect both you and ourselves. We also use it to offer tailored content to you in the form of advertisements which are more relevant and useful to you.</p>
<p>If a third person recommends our services to you, such third person may be made aware of your usage of our services by way of a notification and a reward for such recommendation. In a case where you contact us with queries or feedback, we will store such information to solve any bugs/problems, and for future references too. At the same time, the details you provide to us when you contact us (such as your email address, date and time of such contact etc.) may be stored in order to get back to you, if need be.</p>

<p><strong>WHOM DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION TO?</strong></p>
<p>We do not rent, sell, or otherwise disclose personal information about PocketAd users with unaffiliated third parties. </p>
<p>However, with your consent, we will disclose your personal information to clients that are necessary to provide/facilitate our products and services. Examples include: </p>

<ol  style="margin-left:25px;">
<li><strong>With our clients:</strong></li>
<p>We may have to share your personal information in a random sample of users with advertisers. Such disclosure will only be made in order to allow them to verify the authenticity of our services. While we cannot guarantee each advertiser’s abidance of the contract between us and them, we will contractually prohibit them from using such information for all commercial purposes other than verifying the authenticity of our services. </p>
<p>Even when a client, or a client’s representative, makes contact with you, they shall be required to maintain and share with us the records of any and all communication which takes place between them and you. This will allow us to ensure that your personal information is used in accordance to our Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>The information we collect from you from your usage of our services may be disclosed in complete detail to our clients. For example, if an advertisement requires you to provide your feedback on a certain product, we may be bound to share the same with the concerned advertiser. </p>

<li><strong>For processing:</strong></li>
<p>We may need to process information in order to improve our services, increase protection of data, etc. To meet that end, we may provide your personal information to trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, keeping in mind that the confidentiality and security of your information is of utmost importance. These trusted businesses or persons are contractually restricted from using or disclosing the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf.</p>

<li><strong>For legal requirements:</strong></li>

    <li>to enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations; </li>
    <li>to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; </li>
    <li>to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of YRV Apportunity, our users or the public as required or permitted by law; and</li>
    <li>in the event that YRV Apportunity is subject to a merger or acquisition to the new owner of the business. Disclosure may also be required for company audits or to investigate a complaint or security threat.</li>
	</ol>
</ol>


<p><strong>HOW TO ACCESS AND UPDATE INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p>YRV Apportunity takes reasonable steps to keep your personal information accurate and complete. The information you provide to us during the sign-up process can be accessed and updated from within the mobile application. At the same time, if your PocketAd account is linked with Facebook, you will be able to unlink your PocketAd account from such accounts from within the mobile application.</p>
<p>In such a case where you unlink any account, or update information, we may still preserve your previous information in order to provide you with relevant content.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT DO WE DO TO KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE?</strong></p>
<p>YRV Apportunity has implemented reasonable physical, technical and administrative measures to safeguard the information we collect in connection with the services.

<p><strong>Accessing Your Information:</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to request details about the information we collect and to correct inaccuracies in that information. Any further statutory user rights remain unaffected. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. If you would like to make a request to access your information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@pocketad.co.in" style="color:#333">privacy@pocketad.co.in</a> </p>

<p>If you go to a third-party website or application as a redirection through our app, you will be outside the purview of our control. In such a case, the Privacy Policy set out in such website/application may be superseding, and your personal information may be governed by the same. We would suggest that you consult the concerned website’s Privacy Policy before furnishing any personal information.</p>

Further, it is irrevocably and unconditionally agreed that the courts of New Delhi, India shall have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain any proceedings in relation to any disputes arising out of the same. </p>
